aws_check_integrity
=====

Bash script to check the integrity of a set of local files uploaded into an AWS S3 bucket.


Prerequisites
=============



Description
===========

Considering that our local directory path structure is the same one than the existing on our S3 bucket (please, check the 'Prerequisites' section above) the script will:

1. Loop through the set of files within our local directory.

2. Per each file found in the local folder the script will check its size (if the object found is a directory it will just continue looping through their children files):

   * If the file size is smaller than 8MG, it will generate a simple MD5 digest value.

   * If the file size is bigger than 8MG, it will make a request to a s3md5 function (visit https://github.com/antespi/s3md5 - author: Antonio Espinosa) which will apply the same algorithm as AWS does: it will split the file into 8MG little parts, generate the MD5 hash of each little part and, finally, will generate the final MD5 digest number from the set of individual MD5 hashes.

3. Retrieve the ETag value from the same file stored on the S3 bucket.

4. Compare the retrieved ETag value with the one we have just generated.

   * If both are equals, we can confirm the integrity of the file stored on the S3 bucket. Otherwise, the script will generate an error. In both cases, the result is stored in a log file which name is S3_integrity_log.[timestamp].txt.



Usage
=====
1. First, download [**s3md5** project](https://github.com/antespi/s3md5) and store it within the *aws_check_integrity* folder.
2. Next, grant execution permissions to he s3md5 script file.
```sh
> cd aws_check_integrity
> chmod 755 ./s3md5/s3md5
```
3. Finally:
```
Usage : aws_check_integrity.sh <local_path> <bucket_name> <folder>

- local_path: local path of our server where all previously uploaded files are currently stored. For example: /data/nucCyt/raw_data/. 

- bucket_name: the name of the S3 bucket we want to check. For example: nuccyt. 

- folder: the name of the root folder on the S3 bucket. If there is not any folder in the root, this parameter will be a slash (/) indicating the root path. For example, raw_data/.
```


Example
=======
```
> aws_check_integrity.sh /data/nucCyt/raw_data/ nuccyt raw_data/
```
